# 🎲 Dice Roll Simulation using NumPy

Simulated rolling a dice multiple times using Python and NumPy.  
Analyzed frequency, probability, and basic statistics of outcomes.

## 📌 Features:
- Roll a single die 1000 times
- Count how many times each number (1–6) appears
- Calculate probabilities and mean
- Simulate rolling two dice and sum outcomes

## 🧠 Concepts Used:
- NumPy arrays
- np.random.randint()
- np.bincount(), np.mean()
- Basic probability

## 📁 File
- `dice_simulation.ipynb`

## 🚀 How to Run
Open in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
